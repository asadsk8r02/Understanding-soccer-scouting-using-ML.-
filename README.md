An algorithm that can decompose the performance of players into its main objective elements using scouting data as a strategic asset.By analyzing large datasets of player performance metrics, biographical information, and other relevant data, our algorithm will identify the key performance metrics that contribute to a player's overall success, such as physical attributes, technical skills, and tactical awareness.

By analyzing large datasets of player performance metrics, biographical information, and other relevant data, our algorithm will identify the key performance metrics that contribute to a player's overall success, such as physical attributes, technical skills, and tactical awareness.

## Dataset
The scouting dataset has about 20,000 data points, each representing a player, their
team, and their performance metrics.
The target variable for this dataset is "rating_num," which represents the player's
overall rating. This rating is a continuous variable ranging from 0 to 10.There are
several features included in this dataset that provide information about the player's
physical attributes, playing position, and performance metrics. These features include
"player_position_1", "player_position_2", "player_height", "player_weight", and
various other "player_" features related to their general, positional, offensive, and
defensive performance. Additionally, the dataset includes information about the team
and competition in which the player participated. The "team" column provides
information about the player's team, and the "competitionId" column provides
information about the competition in which the player participated.There is also a
"winner" column, which identifies the winning team for each game. This column
could potentially be used as a feature in the model to determine if a player's
performance is affected by their team's success. Overall, there are a total of 799
columns with most of them representing different metrics of a player which can be
used as features while modeling that can be used to build a machine learning model to
predict a player's overall rating
