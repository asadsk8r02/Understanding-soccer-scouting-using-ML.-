 An algorithm that can decompose the performance of players into its main objective elements using scouting data as a strategic asset.

In the field of sports, player scouting is a critical process that involves
identifying talented players early on to gain a competitive advantage. However,
traditional scouting methods are often subjective and time-consuming, leading to
missed opportunities and poor player selection. To overcome these limitations, our
project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop a more objective and
efficient player scouting system.

The main goal of our project is to create an algorithm that can decompose the
performance of players into its main objective elements using scouting data as a
strategic asset. By analyzing large datasets of player performance metrics,
biographical information, and other relevant data, our algorithm will identify the key
performance metrics that contribute to a player's overall success, such as physical
attributes, technical skills, and tactical awareness.

Using these objective elements, the algorithm will evaluate and compare the
performance of different players, providing teams with valuable insights into player
recruitment and selection. This will help teams identify talented players who may
have been overlooked by traditional scouting methods, leading to improved
performance and success on the field.

Moreover, our project has the potential to contribute to the development of new
techniques and methodologies in the field of machine learning and sports analytics.
By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms, we can create a more
objective and efficient player scouting system that could revolutionize the way sports
teams approach player recruitment and selection.

Overall, our project's final goal is to develop an algorithm that can objectively
analyze the performance of players and provide teams with valuable insights into
player recruitment and selection. This has the potential to improve the scouting
process in sports, ultimately leading to improved performance and success on the
field

## Abstract
The primary objective of this report was to develop a machine learning-based player
scouting system to identify talented players for recruitment and selection in the field
of sports. To achieve this goal, we set out to accomplish three main objectives.

Firstly, we aimed to determine the feature that contributes the most to the target value
by utilizing feature importance analysis with different machine learning models.
Specifically, we utilized the XGBOOST, LGB, and CATBOOST algorithms to
identify the key performance metrics that contribute to a player's success.

Secondly, we used an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to determine the test
rating for players. The ANN was trained on the player's performance metrics,
biographical information, and other relevant data, and was used to predict the player's
potential success in the future.

Lastly, we utilized the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to identify undervalued
or underrated players. We achieved this by applying KNN to players rated less than
six to assign new ratings and then identifying players with the biggest difference. This
approach allowed us to uncover players who may have been overlooked by traditional
scouting methods and were thus undervalued or underrated.
